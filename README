Introduction:
================================================================================

This a AI competition platform, write your AI to competite with other's!


Prerequire:
=================================================

You should have these installed in you system:

* Python 2.6+

* Pygame 1.9+

* linux (currently, if you want start from the 'runserver' and 'runclient' scripts)


How to start:
================================================================================

Before you start, you may want to change something in src/config.py .
To start a server, just execute the script 'runserver'. 
To quit a server, type 'q' or 'quit'

To start a sample client, execute the script 'runclient'.

To start a watching client, use command:  
    ` cd src && python client.py [-h host]`  
Note that 'host' defaults to 'localhost', you must specify the host if you are not going to connect to localhost

To start with your own AI, put your AI python script in src/, say myAI.py, then use command:  
    ` cd src && python client -p myAI [-h host]`  

Game rule:
================================================================================
##Objects
In the game, there are some objects:

* block

* food

* snake's body

* snake's head

* empty place


##Rules:
* a snake is always moving, until it die

* a snake die after hit a snake's body or head or block

* a snake's total length grow up by one when it eat one food

* when a snake die, it disappers

* each round a snake will move one step, it can turn left or right, controlled by the player(AI)

* the field will generate the food randomly

* the blocks will not change

* it's not provided that there are always foods on the field

* the server won't wait until you finish you calculation, it update a round regularlly, so response as fast as you can, or you'll go randomly.

Each player's task is to controll the snake to eat more food, or to trap other players, if your AI is powerful enough.

To write your AI:
================================================================================
First you may want to see the example AI in src/exampleAI.py .
What you need to do is to write a class named SnakeAI, it must be derive from class AISnake.
You should implement two method:

* `SnakeAI.__init__`

* `SnakeAI.__response__`

Things may be useful to you:  

* `from field import FieldClient as F`  

* `F.BODY, F.FOOD, F.HEAD, F.EMPTY,`  

* `field.getContentAt((x, y))`  

* `self.body = [(x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...] ; self.body[0] is the snake's head`  

* `self.direction`  

* `field.dirs = (F.LEFT, F.DOWN, F.RIGHT, F.UP)`  

* `field.size = (W, H)`  

* `The coordinate system of the game, (0, 0) for upper-left, (0, W) for upper-right, (0, H) for lower-left, (W, H) for lower-right.`
